# How to secure Network traffic - 3 ways
The first approach is to use TLS, which provides a convenient way to secure many protocols, such as HTTP, SMTP, and POP3. Protocols secured with TLS usually get an S, for _Secure_, added to their names, such as HTTPS, SMTPS, and POP3S.

The second approach to secure network traffic is to use SSH. Although SSH is mainly used for remote access, it can also transfer files securely and establish secure tunnels. Creating an SSH tunnel is a solid choice if you want to pass the traffic of a plaintext protocol, such as VNC.

The last approach we covered to secure network traffic is using VPN connections. A VPN connection is usually the perfect option for connecting two company branches.
