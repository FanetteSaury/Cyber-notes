- **Modem:** Connects your home network to the internet. It provides a single point of connection and a public IP address.
    
- **Router:** Connects multiple devices within your home to each other and to the internet through the modem. It creates a local area network (LAN), assigns private IP addresses to your devices, and often provides Wi-Fi.
    

Many internet service providers today offer a single device that combines both a modem and a router, often called a **gateway**. This all-in-one device handles both the connection to the internet and the distribution of that connection to all your wired and wireless devices.
