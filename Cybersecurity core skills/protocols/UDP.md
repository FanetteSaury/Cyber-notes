# User Datagram Protocol
User Datagram Protocol (UDP)** is a Transport Layer protocol. UDP is a part of the Internet Protocol suite, referred to as UDP/IP suite. Unlike TCP, it is an ****unreliable and connectionless protocol.**** So, there is no need to establish a connection before data transfer. The UDP helps to establish low-latency and loss-tolerating connections over the network. The UDP enables process-to-process communication
