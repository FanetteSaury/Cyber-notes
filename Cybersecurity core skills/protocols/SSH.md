Secure Shell (SSH) refers to a cryptographic network protocol used in secure communication between devices. SSH encrypts data using cryptographic algorithms, such as Advanced Encryption System (AES) and is often used when logging in remotely to a computer or server.
### History
 It is easy for anyone monitoring the network traffic to get hold of your login credentials once you use `telnet`. This problem necessitated a solution. 
 - Tatu Ylönen developed the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol and released SSH-1 in **1995** as freeware. (Interestingly, it was the same year that Netscape Communications released the SSL 2.0 protocol.) 
 - A more secure version, SSH-2, was defined in 1996. 
 - In **1999**, the OpenBSD developers released **OpenSSH**, an open-source implementation of SSH. Nowadays, when you use an SSH client, it is most likely based on OpenSSH libraries and source code.
