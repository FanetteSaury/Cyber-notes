# Internet Message Access Protocol
## Definition
IMAP allows synchronizing read, moved, and deleted messages. IMAP is quite convenient when you check your email via multiple clients. Unlike POP3, which tends to minimize server storage as email is downloaded and deleted from the remote server, IMAP tends to use more storage as email is kept on the server and synchronized across the email clients.
## Commands
IMAP allows synchronizing read, moved, and deleted messages. IMAP is quite convenient when you check your email via multiple clients. Unlike POP3, which tends to minimize server storage as email is downloaded and deleted from the remote server, IMAP tends to use more storage as email is kept on the server and synchronized across the email clients.
## Example request
Knowing that the IMAP server listens on TCP port 143 by default, we will use `telnet` to connect to `10.10.206.126`’s port 143 and fetch the message we sent in an earlier task.

Terminal

```shell-session
user@TryHackMe$ telnet 10.10.41.192 143
Trying 10.10.41.192...
Connected to 10.10.41.192.

The screenshot below shows the exchanged messages between the client and the server as seen from Wireshark. The client only needed to send four commands, shown in red, and the “long” server responses are shown in blue.
