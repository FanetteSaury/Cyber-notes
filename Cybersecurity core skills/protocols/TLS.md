# Transport Layer Security
## History
In the early 1990s, Netscape Communications recognised the need for secure communication on the World Wide Web. They eventually developed SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and released SSL 2.0 in **1995** as the first public version. In **1999**, the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) developed TLS (Transport Layer Security). Although very similar, TLS 1.0 was an upgrade to SSL 3.0 and offered various improved security measures. In **2018**, TLS had a significant overhaul of its protocol and TLS 1.3 was released. The purpose is not to remember the exact dates but to realise the amount of work and time put into developing the current version of TLS, i.e., TLS 1.3. Over more than two decades, there have been many things to learn from and improve with every version.

Nowadays, tens of protocols have received security upgrades with the simple addition of TLS. Examples include HTTP, DNS, MQTT, and SIP, which have become HTTPS, DoT (DNS over TLS), MQTTS, and SIPS, where the appended “S” stands for Secure due to the use of SSL/TLS. In the following tasks, we will visit HTTPS, SMTPS, POP3S, and IMAPS.
