A network card, also known as a Network Interface Card (NIC), is a hardware component that allows a computer to connect to a network. It acts as an intermediary, translating digital data from the computer into signals that can be transmitted over a network medium, such as an Ethernet cable or Wi-Fi radio waves.

Here are some key functions and characteristics of a network card:

- **Connection Point:** It provides a physical port (like an RJ45 port for an Ethernet cable) or an antenna for a wireless connection.
    
- **Data Translation:** It converts the data from your computer into a format that can be sent across the network, and it also translates incoming data from the network back into a format your computer can understand.
    
- **Unique Address:** Every network card has a unique identifier called a MAC address (Media Access Control address), which is used to identify the computer on the network.
    
- **Wired or Wireless:** Network cards can be wired (using cables) or wireless (using radio waves for Wi-Fi). Many modern computers have both types of network interfaces built into the motherboard.
    
- **Integral Component:** In the past, network cards were often separate expansion cards that you would install in your computer. Today, they are typically integrated directly into the computer's motherboard, especially in laptops and modern desktop PCs.
